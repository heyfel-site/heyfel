> Yeah, I get so many different ideas from people that don’t understand what that means. Well, “Don’t Try? Just be a slacker? lay back?” And I’m no! Don’t try, do. Because if you’re spending your time trying something, you’re not doing it…“DON’T TRY.”

## Who I am

I feel in love with writing from a very young age. Since primary throughout high school, my favorite class has always been **creative writing**. I wrote a lot, both prose and poetry. Yet, as I turned of age, classes started to get more and more technical, and creative writing suddenly disappeared from the schedule. And my writing habit with it. I didn't stop enjoy writing, I just stumbled upon my own quest for a purpose. With my subjects of study increasingly diverting from everyday life - and not in a sense that stimulates creativity - I started to feel like each of my actions necessarily had to serve a tangible purpose. Thus, I competed in the fiction writing contest organized by the school.

I remember feeling extremely frustrated drafting my text. I'd pick a matter I really cared about and try to confine the scope of my writing to it. Failing. I couldn't narrate a story without indulging in lyrical description of the natural landscapes or on the characters' movement of souls. Combine that with an obsessive perfectionist trait, and you get me struggling to fill half a page, only to delete it shortly thereafter. I was too fond of Bukowski's _So you want to be a writer?_ :

> when it is truly time,\
> and if you have been chosen,\
> it will do it by\
> itself and it will keep on doing it\
> until you die or it dies in you.
> 
> there is no other way.
>
> and there never was.

## What is heyfel

I figured out that neither was time nor I was chosen. Yet today, trying to write the *about me* page of this blog, I stumbled upon this interview to Linda Bukowski, in which she gives her interpretation of Charles' *don't try*. It's not about trying when it's all set, it's about **doing** despite the circumstances. And this is precisely the reason behind this blog, to rediscover the joy of writing against imperfections.

Here you'll find a collection of essays, tutorials, and guides in the form of a *digital garden*. Unlike a traditional blog, a digital garden offers '**evergreen**' content that is constantly updated and improved over the years. Just like gardens need seasonal trimming to look their best, so does this website here. 

The **essays** will range from my family's history to issues of social and environmental justice. They'll be drafted with scholarly vigor but with an emphasis on making them more readable and appealable to the wider public.

The **guides** will provide you with a behind-the-scenes look at the development of this website and my productivity setups, as well as offer university and internships advice based on my experience. Don't expect anything about cars, travels and proper gardening. For now.
 
Finally, to overcome my self-diagnosed perfectionist obsession, I'll keep a **diary** to jot down thoughts and ideas, which may serve as seeds for future essays and guides. Feel free to comment on which topics you'd like me to explore further. The diary is also a way for me to seriously commit to journaling and for letting you all know, whether you feel overwhelmed, ruminating or over perfectionist, that you're not alone.
